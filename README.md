# README #

Requires some of my utility functions and classes, which are not public.

Uses Calcium imaging data, which is not included.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Uses Dynamic Mode Decomposition to analyze C elegans behavior
* Note: For introduction and examples look at ./doc
* ./Zimmer_analysis_functions contains the current work:
	* Zimmer_analysis.m is basically my lab manual (all the scripts I've run)
	* Zimmer_paper_plots.m produces the plots in the paper
	* Zimmer_interactive_plots.m produces a couple interactive plots for exploration

### How do I get set up? ###

#### Without downloading anything else you can:
* View the doc folder, particularly the pdfs
	* These go through the basic DMD analysis and how Robust PCA is used
	* Hopefully will include some more recent results soon!

#### Requirements to run:
* Get my utility functions, and run their setup script
* Get data files from an amazing experimentalist
* Praise the experimentalist

### Contribution guidelines ###

### Who do I talk to? ###
